<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>One meal is not going to get you far! Let's create the main menu to add several meals and display their properties. For this, we need to add a few commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">Add</code> starts the meal input process and prompts users for the meal properties;</li>
<li><code class="java">Show</code> prints the list of saved meals with their names, categories, and ingredients;</li>
<li>After executing <code class="java">add</code> or <code class="java">show</code>, the program should ask what users want to do next;</li>
<li>The program must run until users input <code class="java">exit</code> â€” the command that terminates the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this stage, your program should also check the user input. What if users enter something wrong?</p>
<ul>
<li>If the input meal category is something other than <code class="java">breakfast</code>, <code class="java">lunch</code>, or <code class="java">dinner</code>, print <code class="java">Wrong meal category! Choose from: breakfast, lunch, dinner.</code> and prompt users for input;</li>
<li>If the meal's name or ingredients have a wrong format (for example, there are numbers or non-alphabet characters; ingredients are blank, and so on), print <code class="java">Wrong format. Use letters only!</code> and prompt users for input. Meal's name or ingredients containing several words like "peanut butter" should not be matched as wrong format.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>To complete this stage, the program must comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an infinite loop of your program that can be terminated with the <code class="java">exit</code> command only;</li>
<li>Prompt users to choose an operation with the message <code class="java">What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?</code></li>
<li>After the command has been processed, ask for another operation;</li>
<li>Make sure that the input and output formats are correct;</li>
<li>If users want to <code class="java">add</code> a meal, follow the sequence from the previous stage. Don't forget to validate input as explained above. Output <code class="java">The meal has been added!</code> before proceeding;</li>
<li>If users want to <code class="java">show</code> the meals when no meals have been added, print <code class="java">No meals saved. Add a meal first.</code> If there are meals that can be dislayed, print them in the order they've been added, following the format from Stage 1;</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">Bye!</code> and end the program once the <code class="java">exit</code> command is entered;</li>
<li>If users fail to input a valid command, print the following message again: <code class="java">What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?</code></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
