<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Let's improve the navigation in the program and make it more user-friendly! In this stage, we will enhance the <code class="java">show</code> command. The program will ask users to specify the meal category with the following message: <code class="java">Which category do you want to print (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?</code> After this, the program will search through the database and print only the chosen category. If the requested category is empty, the program should show an appropriate message.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>When users input <code class="java">show</code>, your program should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask users for the meal category;</li>
<li>Search through the database for meals from the chosen category;</li>
<li>Print <code class="java">Category: &lt;category&gt;</code>. For each meal, print <code class="java">Meal's name: &lt;meal name&gt;</code>, followed by the specific meal ingredients list, each on a new line. The meals and ingredients should be printed <strong>in the same order</strong> they've been added;</li>
<li>If the input category doesn't exist, print <code class="java">Wrong meal category! Choose from: breakfast, lunch, dinner.</code>;</li>
<li>If there're no meals in the category, print <code class="java">No meals found.</code></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
