<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Let's start with something simple. Write a program that can store meals and their properties. Prompt users about the category of a meal (<code class="java">breakfast</code>, <code class="java">lunch</code>, or <code class="java">dinner</code>), name of a meal, and necessary ingredients. The program should print that information with the meal properties in the correct format. In this stage, you don't need to validate user input.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>To complete this stage, your program should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask about the meal category with the following message: <code class="java">Which meal do you want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?</code>;</li>
<li>Ask about the name of the meal with the message <code class="java">Input the meal's name:</code>;</li>
<li>Inquire about the necessary ingredients with the message <code class="java">Input the ingredients:</code>. The input contains ingredients in one line separated by commas. The output displays each ingredient on a new line (see Examples);</li>
<li>Print all the information about the meal in the following format:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java">Category: category
Name: meal's name
Ingredients:
ingredient 1
ingredient 2
ingredient 3</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Print the message that the meal is saved successfully: <code class="java">The meal has been added!</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples"> Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong><em>standard</em><em> execution — lunch</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Which meal do you want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?
