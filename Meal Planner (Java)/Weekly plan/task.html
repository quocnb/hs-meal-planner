<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>A solid person plans for the week ahead! Let's help our users plan their meals for the entire week. In this stage, we will add a new command — <code class="java">plan</code>. We also need to change the main menu accordingly. From now on, it should read as <code class="java">What would you like to do (add, show, plan, exit)?</code></p>
<p>When users input <code class="java">plan</code>, the program should print the first day of the week, <code class="java">Monday</code>, and print the list of all breakfasts stored in the database in <strong>alphabetical order</strong>. After this, the program should ask users to pick a meal with the following message: <code class="java">Choose the breakfast for Monday from the list above:</code></p>
<p>After users input a meal option, the program should verify it. If it's not stored in the database, print <code class="java">This meal doesn’t exist. Choose a meal from the list above.</code> If the input is correct, move on to the next category — <code class="java">lunch</code> and then to <code class="java">dinner</code>. Once the meals for three categories are picked, print <code class="java">Yeah! We planned the meals for Monday.</code> Repeat these steps for other weekdays. In the end, print the whole plan for the week.</p>
<p>Save the plan to the database. For this purpose, create a new table named <code class="java">plan</code> when the program starts. This table contains the meal option, meal category, and <code class="java">meal_id</code>. The third column must match the <code class="java">meal_id</code> columns of the other two tables. You are free to choose how to implement the fields in this table. If a new plan is created, delete the old plan.</p>
